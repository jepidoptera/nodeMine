Have you ever sat at your computer looking at a terminal window, and thought "I could really go for a game of minesweeper right now?"  Well now you can - without leaving the terminal!  Mouse support is implemented though Blessed.js, and the game should feel almost like what you remember from Windows 95.

Instructions:
1. git clone https://github.com/jepidoptera/nodeMine.git
2. npm install
3. node mines.js

All code by Peter Allen VI.  Enjoy.
