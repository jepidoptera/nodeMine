Have you ever sat at your computer looking at a terminal window, and thought "I could really go for a game of minesweeper right now?"  Well now you can - without leaving the terminal!  Mouse support is implemented though Blessed.js, and the game should feel almost like what you remember from Windows 95.

Instructions:
1. git clone https://github.com/jepidoptera/nodeMine.git
2. cd nodeMine
3. npm install
4. node mines.js

You can play with the mouse in some terminals.  If yours doesn't support mouse, the controls are:
arrow keys to move.
"f" to flag.
"m" for menu.
spacebar to click a square, select a menu item, or start over once the game is done.

All code by Peter Allen VI.  Enjoy.
